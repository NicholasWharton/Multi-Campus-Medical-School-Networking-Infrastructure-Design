# Multi-Campus-Medical-School-Networking-Infrastructure-Design
Designed a Multi-Campus Medical Schools networking infrastructure. This included campuses in multiple regions of the US and Europe which were connected through the Azure Cloud Infrastructure. Because of this, the design had to comply with the legislation
of each of the regions. I provided a majority of the infrastructure content in compliance with the legislation laid out. In addition to providing the compliance research for PCI DSS.
